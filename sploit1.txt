Exploit 1
by Saul Laufer
_________

Vulnerability:
target1.c contains an unchecked strcpy. That is, it attempts to copy an input char array to a local char array of length 240. The target program does not check to determine if the length of the input char array is longer than the destination char array, leaving the program vulnerable for attack.

Exploit:
The exploit is a classic buffer overflow; the idea being that my buffer overwrites the function’s (foo’s) return address (%eip) and replaces it with an address inside my injection buffer. When the function attempts to return, it reads NOP instructions until it reaches shell code. The return address begins 5 bytes past the end of the buffer (in between the allocated local buffer space and the frame pointer) and ends 8 bytes after, hence the size 248.
